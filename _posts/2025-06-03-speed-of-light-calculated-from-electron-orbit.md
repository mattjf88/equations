I looked at numerical symbols and found I could calculate a constant the speed of light from other constatns an electrons orbit.

Here's the path i followed:

1.First, I started with known values, Bohr's first electron radius and the velocity of an electron.
Let V and R be specific numerical values,<br>
Let V=2.18 × 10<sup>6</sup> ,<br>
Let R=5.29177 × 10<sup>-11</sup> <br>

2.Next, I calculated a circumfrence-like value (C):<br>
Define C=2&#960;R<br>
C=2 × 3.14 × 5.29177 × 10<sup>-11</sup> <br>
Calculating this gives:<br>
C=3.3249 × 10<sup>-10</sup> <br>

3.Then, I found a time-like value (T<sub>1</sub>): <br>
Define T<sub>1</sub>=C ÷ V<br>
T<sub>1</sub>=3.3249×10<sup>-10</sup>  ÷ 2.18×10<sup>6</sup><br>
T<sub>1</sub>=1.5251×10<sup>-16</sup> <br>

4.Then, a scaled time value (T<sub>2</sub>): <br>
Define T<sub>2</sub>=T<sub>1</sub> ÷ 4<br>
T<sub>2</sub>=1.5251×10<sup>-16</sup>÷4<br>
T<sub>2</sub>=3.8129×10<sup>-17</sup><br>

5.I applied these to the first expression, E<sub>1</sub>(t,h):<br>
The expression is defined as:<br>
E<sub>1</sub>(t,h)=((2 × t)<sup>2</sup>  × (t)<sup>.25</sup>  ) ÷ ((h+(h ÷ 15)) × t)<br>
Substitute t = T<sub>2</sub> , h = R<br>
E<sub>1</sub>(t,h) = ((2 × 3.8129×10<sup>-17</sup> )<sup>2</sup> × (3.8129×10<sup>-17</sup> )<sup>.25</sup> ) ÷ ((5.29177 × 10<sup>-11</sup> +(5.29177 × 10<sup>-11</sup>  ÷ 15)) × 3.8129×10<sup>-17</sup> )<br>
Calculating this gives:<br>
E<sub>1</sub>(T<sub>2</sub> , R)=2.123×10<sup>-10</sup><br>

6.Finally, using the second expression  E<sub>2</sub>(t,h,N):<br>
E<sub>2</sub>(t,h,N) = ((2 × t)<sup>2</sup> × (t)<sup>.25</sup> ) ÷ ((N - (h÷ 15)) × t × 4<sup>3</sup> )<br> 
Substitute t=1, h=R, N=E<sub>1</sub>(T<sub>2</sub> , R)<br>
E<sub>2</sub>(1,R,E_1) = ((2 × 1)<sup>2</sup> × (1)<sup>.25</sup> ) ÷ ((2.123×10<sup>-10</sup>  - (5.29177 × 10<sup>-11</sup>  ÷ 15)) × 1 × 4<sup>3</sup>)<br>

Calculating this gives:<br>
E<sub>2</sub>(1,R,E_1)=299,369,427<br><br><br>

The model to equation, a one dimensional oscillation can start from the center field then move out to the end field which is a change in direction back to the center. The right movement would be (a) , the left movement a fall to the center would be (b) , it is then (a/b) because if (a) was earth (b) would be a asteroid pulling back with its small gravity, there's a mutual change in direction so one is dependent on the other and their a fraction,this started as outgoing. These movements are dependent on the two changes in direction, the center and the end, that make it (a/b)^2, squared because any distance on the first movement is any point for a movement in a dimension to move . That's half the oscillation so double this and it becomes (2a/b)^2. The is another way to move about this model, it's from end to end. Starting from incoming, pulled from end the two halves are equal to each other because there was no change in direction in the center of the oscillation , just momentum, and they are different, ones toward the center as a fall so that is (b) and the other, the puller,  is gravity from the other side of the oscillation. There is a (b) and a gravity so it's (2a/Gravityb^2)^2 ,it's inserted into the denominator ,the equation was divided by f a movement that when divided changes direction so it's dependent.  With simplification and (a) and (b) turning into time it turns into (((2 time)^2(time^(¼))/Gravity Time)=height. Equal to height is the integral of gravity.  With simplification it is ((2×time)^2×(time)^.25)÷((height+(height÷15))×time)=Gravity.The height divided by 15  , there are 5 possible movements within a change in direction and 3 changes in direction all together, .4^3 is, the 4 is 2 plus 2, plus because there's gravity and momentum, and 2 because in a two body system there are two points the body's make each other turn direction, when there both at each end and when there each in the center . The 3 is that there is a momentum for every turn and for every movement, their all three per each other

Section 3.4 The field equations

<br>

f<sup>-1</sup>K move f a divergence - 1, divergence with the -1 to somewhere or a movement to a K
with some sort of script from somewhere, just think its f<sup>-1</sup>K<sub>a</sub> which would be a movement
from possibly the frame to K<sub>a</sub> a integral outside the frame, the frame would be the middle of
the oscillation and the integral is a spot you can integrate a movement and get a change in
direction

<br><br>

f<sup>2</sup> =- K<sup>a</sup>K<sub>a</sub> Left: go to one side like your going to come back but while you are there tell
yourself to go all the way to the opposite side, Right:K a movement to one side of the frame,
K the first integral t's on both sides of frame, the first integral being a value to get a derivative
from to get a vector and t is the end of a wrap where it starts wrapping again so it will turn
direction there, this is a one dimensional pendulum,negative says the small object is pulling

<br><br>

V<sup> .a</sup>=V<sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub>V<sup>b</sup>=f<sup> -1</sup>f<sup> ;b</sup>g<sup>ab</sup> Middle:V<sup>a</sup> a full wrap on one side of the frame, ;b a t at the frame and v<sup>b</sup> is a wrap per a t's change in direction, same thing as changing sides Right: f<sup> -1</sup>f<sub> ;a</sub> is motion to one side of the frame,g<sup>ab</sup> is the first derivative of the matter density of earth witch is G equal to one wrap because G is a multiplier for one osculation, one wrap is motion from frame back to frame and is says ab it wants both sides of frame

<br><br>

V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub> = -V<sup> .a</sup>V<sub>b</sub>, Right: V<sub>b</sub>,a t on one side,is equal to one wrap

<br><br>

V<sup> .a</sup>V<sub>a</sub>= 0 conservation V<sub>a</sub> a t on either side, both wraps are equal

<br><br>

-V<sup> .</sup> makes sure there are changes in direction

<br><br>

f - 1  1 at the change in direction the object is being pulled, it is always being pulled

<br><br>

V<sup> .a</sup><sub> ;a</sub> = (v<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub>V<sup>b</sup>)<sub> ;a</sub> ;a cant change negative to positive at the frame ;b is already doing that so it will change positive to negative slightly away from the frame, it pulls the particle to the frame

<br><br>

=V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b;a</sub>V<sup>b</sup>+V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub>V<sup>b</sup><sub> ;a</sub> the right side(V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b;a</sub> ) is going to tell the left side(V<sup>b</sup><sub> ;a</sub> ) to pull in because the right side(V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub>) is times the left side(V<sup>b</sup><sub> ;a</sub>) and the left side(V<sup>b</sup><sub> ;a</sub>) is going to tell the the right side(V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b;a</sub>) to diverge because the left side(V<sup>b</sup>) is times the right side(V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b;a</sub>) and repeat because of ;a in(V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b;a</sub>) and the +

<br><br>

= R<sub>ab</sub>V<sup>a</sup>V<sup>b</sup>+(v<sup>a</sup><sub> ;a</sub>)<sub> ;b</sub> v<sup>b</sup> + (V<sub>b</sub>V<sup> .b</sup>)<sup>2</sup> Left:V says what R's G is, R is along the integral curve, it's all the divergences Middle: a distance a out then pull in ;a per ;b, if ;b changes sign there is
still ;a but opposite, times V<sup>b</sup> so V a V or ;a a b or pull a distance going out Right:V<sub>b</sub>, the potential or a distance away from the puller and v<sup> .a</sup> the time to move in a wrap and 2 they are per each other so if one is given the other is found

But V<sup> .a</sup><sub> ;a</sub> = (f<sup> -1</sup>f<sub> ;b</sub>g<sup>ab</sup> )<sub> ;a</sub>    g<sup>ab</sup> first derivative of matter density gives mass = G inside of ;a ,which is a property of pulling, pulling something with G gravity to somewhere with the f 's somewhere from the frame with ;b, there are two divergences from the frame but we want one with f<sup> -1</sup>,one divergence = one distance = one height, this makes the next equation equal to height

<br><br>

=-f<sup> -2</sup>f<sub> ;a</sub>f<sub> ;b</sub>g<sup>ab</sup>+f<sup> -1</sup>f<sub> ;ba</sub>g<sup>ab</sup> Left: at divergence f is per each other f and f,with ^-2, gives (; a/; b)<sup>2</sup> because the -2 is like -1, a divergence at the frame, but it is two so it wants to know (; a/; b)2 because the -2 is like -1, a divergence at the frame, but it is two so it wants to know where else to go after the divergence, a squared tells a divergence to go to the other side of the frame, ;a ;b would be the object pulled in, ;a pulling from each outer integral, to the frame,;b, for f<sub> ;a</sub> there are two distances, the equal and opposite reaction,pull from the outer integrals a lot until it hits zero, f<sub> ;a</sub> = one wrap, because it's the same as going from the frame out then back to the frame except an equal distance is from the outer integral to the other outer integral, = one fall, because if a object falls to earth that's like going from a outer integral to the frame when it
hits the ground then the other part of the wrap is the equal reaction of the object that is falling
pulling on the earth, the other side of the frames divergence, it has to be something pulling that
is always pulling in the process of falling and the small body is doing that because of the
negative sign in the equation that says you always pull, = one time, which is ;a because time is
a series and pulling constantly is a series, for f<sub> ;b</sub> , there are two divergences a movement of distance at the frame for the puller and the pulled, = one fall, one divergence would equal one fall but here g<sup>ab</sup> is the first derivative of mass and there is only one mass to consider when deriving, the mass of the pulled or in this case the pulled mass divergence = one distance,not
time because we have a orientation at the frame with ;b which is position so it would be fitting to say distance is similar to position, f<sub> ;a</sub> per f<sub> ;b</sub>, gives one time per one divergence gives ;a/;b, per per per from the 3 f 'sgives (2(; a/; b))<sup>2</sup>, the 2 is there because of the ^-2 there are 2 wraps, there are 2 wraps in a full osculation from start to finish,from frame out then past frame and then
back to frame, like a tesla coil, for our one fall and one divergence Right: f<sup> -1</sup> f<sub> ;ba</sub>g<sup>ab</sup> the ;b combines the left side, it is a movement f at the frame with the ;b saying mess with it some more, it's where the equation started, this is per a, a integral on both
sides of the frame and the only wrap available from there is a wrap crossing the frame = a
distance even though there are two distances in a wrap f<sup> -1</sup> makes you not care because a divergence is no more than from a t to a t (like multiplying by 1) which = one gravity or G
because the first derivative of mass g<sup>ab</sup> of a divergence would be the G of that mass,the pulled, gives ;a/(GtimesDistance), same as ;a/;b<sup>2</sup> going back through the = signs both ;b and G = one fall = ;b gives (2;a/;b<sup>2</sup>),gives time given height when you multiply /;b by ;b^1/4 on numerator and denominator after the ^2 over the parenthesis and make it = ;b from ; b<sup> 4</sup>,leaves 

<br><br>

PAGE 3

<br><br>

((2;a)<sup>2</sup>;b<sup> 1/4</sup>)/(;b)=height, the ;b^1/4 is a<sup> 1/4</sup> because both ;a and ;b = one fall = one time if you go through the ='s leaves ((2;a)<sup>2</sup>;a<sup> 1/4</sup>)/(;a)=height and the next equation says why a bodies gravity multiplier would be in this equation

<br><br>

And f<sub> ;ab</sub> V<sup>a</sup>V<sup>b</sup>  
the ;a is pulling in after a divergence at the frame the same as the previous equation making it per b one integral on the outside of the frame and the only wrap available from there is a wrap crossing the frame and since there is one wrap from b this = two distances and even though there are two V<sup>a</sup> per V<sup>b</sup> makes you not care (like multiplying by 1) gives G as a multiplier to the previous equation, this leaves ((2;a)<sup>2</sup>;b<sup> 1/4</sup>)/(G;b)=height, ((2t)<sup>2</sup>t<sup> 1/4</sup>)/(Gt)=height in meters and seconds 

<br><br>

To go backwards and find time from height: to find time from distance ;b is a wrap is a sec is same as multiplying by 1 then ; b = t but the product of t's in the denominator has to = ;b that came from a product because if you multiply by 1 you should have the same local result so t is t<sup> 1/4</sup> to send t<sup>4</sup> back to ;b, in the first equation meters is 2 because there are 2 distances from the frame in a wrap, the 2 and t and squared and t<sup>4</sup> are there from the last equation Gives

<br><br>

((2 meters t sec)<sup>2</sup>)/(t<sup>4</sup>t<sup>1/4</sup> sec) = (4(t<sup>2</sup>t<sup>4</sup> meters sec))/(t<sup>1/4</sup> sec) =(4(t<sup>1/2</sup> meters sec))/(t<sup>1/4</sup> sec)=x meters or (x/4)<sup><sup>(5/6<sup>(1/4)</sup>)</sup></sup>=t seconds

<br><br>

=-f<sub> ;a</sub>V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub>V<sup>b</sup> like f<sup>2</sup> except it also says to pull in the entire way with the f<sub> ;a</sub> like gravity of the larger body would act and the minus wants the smaller body to be the recipient by puting G in the above equation

<br><br>

=-f<sup> -1</sup>f<sub> ;a</sub>f<sub> ;b</sub>,g<sup>ab</sup> same thing except the zero is at the pulled with the one divergence, in a wrap from the frame there is a divergence for puller and pulled, and the minus

<br><br>

So One Finds f<sub> ;ab</sub>(g<sup>ab</sup> + V<sup>a</sup>V<sup>b</sup>) = fR<sub>ab</sub>V<sup>a</sup>V<sup>b</sup> Left: f the acceleration equation times the matter density Right: all the switches R moving f times R's wrap V<sup>a</sup>V<sup>b</sup> equaling whatever G the wrap is, g<sup>ab</sup> first derivative of matter density gives mass = G, g<sub>ab</sub> first integral of ab matter density derivative gives mass a mass for potential

<br><br>

R<sub>ab</sub>= K<sub>ab</sub> take out the matter density in K,need the G in R to do the f in K

<br><br>

R<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup><sub> ;b</sub>= 1/2R<sub> ;a</sub> Left: first integral a per first derivative b a change in sign at the frame ;b, the conservation comes from only being able to change signs at the frame so any time after the frame it remains positive, pull a conserved amount a during some distance b every t at the frame ;b, at every ;b switches direction on superscript b or a, Right: one pull per two pulls can't be the same pull if it where're two or it would be 2/2 so the pull changes direction, as long as the first integral swaps the same R is conserved

<br><br>

PAGE 4

<br><br>

K<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup><sub> ;b</sub>=1/2K<sub> ;b</sub>K<sub>a</sub>  the first integral t's on either side, K, the first integral a t on one side, K<sup>b</sup> the first derivative tangents to K<sub> b</sub>, K<sub> ;b</sub>, a change in sign a t at the frame, if there is the conservation R there are curves t like ;b in K then there are Tangent vectors to the t like b of K

<br><br>

K<sub>ab</sub>= 4&#960;GT<sub>ab</sub> Left: per a per b implies T = 0, T ,plus the vector after two t's on either side Right: every a after t for potential does not sum to 0 so the equation is not correct, &#956; - 3p is not constant it sums positive by + &#949;

<br><br>

Thoughts on K<sub>ab</sub> = 4&#960;GT<sub>ab</sub> right: if it left the first integral a t on either side and changed signs there all the way to the t on the other it would stay negative all the way it doesn't say in this equation the sign changes at the frame then &#960;- &#960; implies T<sub> ;a</sub> = 0 which sounds ok now because a negative pull plus a positive pull is 0 but this doesn't make sense going around a circle, there is no tin parallel with the x-axis so this so called negative when leaving the t on one side is actually positive because G is negative and can only affect the opposite sign therefore the change in sign is at the frame, this means that per a can be per b because there is conservation between b then there must be conservation after a, the 4&#960; looks like 2&#960; because you get 2&#960; from per a per b then the osculation doesn't just end after hitting just one of the t's in b, it's per t per t witch is 2 but just think it would keep going but it shows the 2 as the last of the complete osculation, the equation looks ok

<br><br>

K<sub>ab</sub>= k(T<sub>ab</sub> - (1/2)Tg<sub>ab</sub>) + &#8743;g<sub>ab</sub>T<sub>ab</sub> a a b, two a's for two b's, minus the vector with mass in it the fall just ;a going out and leaves a vector, bring back mass next to it for potential

<br><br>

Section 3.8

<br><br>

T<sup>ab</sup>= (&#929;(1 + &#949;) + &#929;<sup>2</sup>(d&#949;/d&#929;))V<sup>a</sup>V<sup>b</sup> +&#929<sup>2</sup>(d&#949;/d&#929;)g<sup>ab</sup>: &#929;(1+ &#949;) pulled fall plus &#929;<sup>2</sup>(d&#949;/d&#929;) puller pull plus &#929<sup>2</sup>(d&#949;/d&#929;)g<sup>ab</sup> puller a pulled, fall says puller pull so this last pulled allows pulled to pull

 -f<sup> -2</sup>f<sub> ;a</sub>f<sub> ;b</sub>g<sup>ab</sup> +f<sup> -1</sup>f<sub> ;ba</sub>g<sup>ab</sup> - f<sup> -2</sup>f<sub> ;a</sub>f<sub> ;b</sub>(V<sup>a</sup>)<sup> -2</sup>g<sup>ab</sup>
 Last is: (points a meter a time)/(;b distancd a a; a meter)<sup>4</sup> , points is the space between the matter density a and b,two bodies, of g<sup>ab</sup> which is possible because it is per f<sup> -2</sup>,f requires a movement of dimension , in the numerator a meter a time is f<sub> ;a</sub> per f<sub> ;b</sub> in the denominator ;b would be g<sup>ab</sup> per V<sup>a</sup> , just a because that would be one wrap of earth, distance a a; is V<sup>a</sup>, and a meter in the denominator is g<sup>b</sup> per V<sup>a</sup>,the 4 is the squares added, goes to ((point meter<sup>2</sup>)/(G distance<sup>2</sup> - meter))<sup>4</sup> meter = seconds, point and distance = V<sup>a</sup>from derivative (V<sup>a</sup>)<sup> -2</sup> -meter: subtract distance at the pulled to get a zero at the pulled. Same as ((distance<sup>4</sup>seconds<sup>8</sup>)/(Gdistance<sup>8</sup>-seconds<sup>4</sup>)) and subtract it from height equation

Section 4.The physical significance of curvature

<br><br>

(D/&#8706;s)Z<sup>a</sup>=V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub>Z<sup>b</sup> 
<br>
 Z=(&#8706;/&#8706;t)<sub>&#955;(t,s)</sub> the &#955; in &#955;(t, s) first came as &#955;(t)this is a curve or the first integral with a change in direction, it is the integral of Z, is 'may construct a family &#955;(t, s) of curves by moving each point of the curve &#955;(t) a distance s along the integral curves of V<sup> '</sup>, &#955;(t) all the curves of Z but we are interested in the frame, a distance s a family of V, V is spread apart for two bodies until it moves into a family about to move a distance at s again along the integral curves of V, so s is where the two bodies meet in one dimension, the equation is looking for relative acceleration by comparing the two different bodies, what is of interest is the D, it tells us where Z<sup>a</sup> will end if some factors are known, the factors that are known is that the two bodies are apart and they are going to meet the same as if they were on opposite sides of a circle traveling in the same direction around and go 90 degrees around, we know s that's where we see them meet but we don't know it yet until we find out about what Z<sup>b</sup> is doing, &#8706; is known as a starting position for Z<sup>a</sup> because it's the distance away from where they meet, ; b the frame of Z<sup>b</sup> is unknown until we see Vª work with ;b, these two working together will give a wrap between the curves outside of the frame of Z<sup>b</sup>, it's in the middle so now we know ;b and if it's behaving like a osculation pulling on each other it's also the family &#955;(t, s), so use the difference of &#8706; and s to get D which is the wrap between the outside curves,now you know where Z<sup>a</sup> starts and ends for a half osculation, the equation <sub>&#8869;</sub>(D/&#8706;s)(<sub>&#8869;</sub>Z<sup>a</sup>)=V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub> <sub>&#8869;</sub>Z<sup>b</sup> will give the full
osculation, the equation<sub>&#8869;</sub>Z<sup>a</sup>=h<sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub>Z<sup>b</sup> really gives the full osculation with the help of <sub>&#8869;</sub>D, h<sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub>=&#948;<sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub>+V<sup>a</sup>V<sub>b</sub> next to Z<sup>b</sup> is,V<sup>a</sup>V<sub>b</sub> ,the wrap of b to one side of the frame telling where the two bodies meet two times every one of these wraps in a full osculation with subscript b repeating it and superscript a getting the endpoints, delta would repeat a wrap of Z<sup>a</sup> between the outside curves with superscript a getting the endpoints with the help of <sub>&#8869;</sub>D and subscript repeats the wrap every time its orthogonal to the outside curves, the plus gave Z<sup>a</sup> the meeting properties of Z<sup>b</sup>

<br><br>

watching the deviation equation further, with a deviation meaning both bodies are moving away from their original meeting point, we introduce dual orthonormal bases E<sub>1</sub> ,E<sub>2</sub> ,E<sub>3</sub>,E<sub>4</sub> and  E<sup>1</sup> ,E<sup>2</sup> ,E<sup>3</sup>,E<sup>4</sup> of T<sub>q</sub> andT<sup> .</sup><sub>q</sub> at some point q on an integral curve &#947;(s) of V, with E<sup>4</sup>=V.E<sup>4</sup> would be a wrap in between the outside curves, then parallelly propagate the E 's along &#947;(s), &#947;(s) is the two bodies meeting point changing position, so (D/&#8706;s) of each vector is zero, so that each outside curve starts the deviation from the beginning or zero so that we can start counting a new position, E<sub>4</sub> which is s will not remain equal to V because V was in the

<br><br>

Page 6

<br><br>


simplest osculation, and E<sub>1</sub> ,E<sub>2</sub> ,E<sub>3</sub> which are a ;b for each body and one outside curve, will not remain orthogonal to V, meaning the curves do not produce the same change in direction for the distance it wants, and  E<sup>1</sup> ,E<sup>2</sup> ,E<sup>3</sup> are the 3 known D's,one D is a wrap between V<sub>a</sub> and the other two are wraps in both of the V<sup>a</sup> in a oscillation, to find D along &#947;(s) we need the Fermi derivative

<br><br>

(D<sub>F</sub>X)/(&#8706;s)=(DX)/(&#8706;s)-g(X,(DV/&#8706;s))V+g(X,V)(DV/&#8706;s): (DX)/(&#8706;s) how much the one body moved over from &#955;(t, s)
 minus <sub>&#8869;</sub>Z<sup>a</sup> the first D after it moves over from &#955;(t, s) and the two bodies meet g(X,(DV/&#8706;s))V, plus our new very first D g(X,V)(DV/&#8706;s) gives us the total location of the osculation

<br><br>

Section 4.2 Null curves

<br><br>

Just like the Fermi derivative the two bodies equalize their osculation to a new position with the larger body slightly moving and the smaller body equalizing after its movement a nucleus and electron become stable to a heavier element with the nucleus losing the bigger bodies slight movement in light energy and the new electrons matching the new total,this is like back from the Fermi derivative to <sub>&#8869;</sub>(D/&#8706;s)(<sub>&#8869;</sub>Z<sup>a</sup>)=V<sup>a</sup><sub> ;b</sub><sub>&#8869;</sub>Z<sup>b</sup> a stable two body oscillation, what we try to do is find the approximate speed of light with the available data, since the Fermi derivative and Z<sup>a</sup> are the same stable osculation just with a deviation this gives <sub>&#8869;</sub>(D/&#8706;s)(<sub>&#8869;</sub>Z<sup>a</sup>)=(DX/&#8706;s)-(g(X,(DV/&#8706;s))V)+(g(X,V)(DV/&#8706;s)),take -(g(X,(DV/&#8706;s))V) on the left side of the equation and find the G of a hydrogen atom knowing -(g(X,(DV/&#8706;s))V) lets us use the radius of the smallest electron as the meters

<br><br>

going to the right side of the equation a stable deviation gives the energy released by the deviation because a hydrogen atom that is now a helium atom deviated per two wraps of a hydrogen atom, the reduced equation is (DX/&#8706;s)+(g(X,V)(DV/&#8706;s)), the g(X,V) allows us to use the time=height equation with G of the atom because the X deviation lets us use the time value of helium from hydrogen and V lets us use the time=height equation, the (DX/&#8706;s) is deviation per as or just s which is per 2 wraps or orthogonals and combine it with 2 coming from the left side of the equation that is there because <sub>&#8869;</sub>(D/&#8706;s) is a D per sor just 2 orthogonals and you get 4 in the denominator, the (DV/&#8706;s) is all the D's we know of, there are 3 in two bodies, the V is per s and when V is per s that is already per something else, the entire deviation X from per s from (DX/&#8706;s), its per per per so it will root the per X per s by the per D in (DV/&#8706;s), there are V in X that never had its say with s until now, so it's going to be 4<sup>3</sup> in the denominator
